JSHG - Javascript Hand Gesture Plugin
========================================

Javascript Hand Gesture Plugin (JSHG) is a wonderful plugin that allows you to 
support the hand gesture recognition of users through web camera in your 
existing websites or web applications. You do not need to have any background 
in computer vision to use this plugin. It currently offers the basic set of hand 
gestures which include the position of hand (left, right, up, down) and counts the number of fingers. 
We provides a well-designed API for you to integrate JSHG to your application easily. 
If you have strong background in computer vision, it is very simple for you to 
customize JSHG according to your preference.

**Note**: This plugin uses JSCV library which is developed by Intel, Harvey Mudd College and 
National University of Singapore.
